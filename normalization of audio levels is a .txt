normalization of audio levels is a process used to adjust the volume of an audio signal to a standard or desire level.
the goal of normalization is to consits the loudness and pitch from being too quiet or too loud.
select an audio editing softaware by using adobe audition
import your audio file
select audio part to noormalize u can select full audio file or u can select the specific part of audio file.
normalize audio:in adobe audition fo to the effect menu select amplitude and compression and then choose normalize adjust the settings as needed.
preview and apply:before applying the normalization preview of audio and adjsut according to settings.
apply normalization:once u applied the settings according to your option apply normalization.
this process adjust the volume levels.
save the normalization audio:
after the normalization you save the audio.
Use normalization as a part of your overall audio processing workflow. It's common to perform other tasks such as equalization, compression, and limiting to achieve the desired audio quality.
Consider using LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale) normalization for broadcast or streaming content, as it takes into account perceived loudness rather than just peak levels.
It's a good practice to work with high-resolution audio files (e.g., 24-bit) to maintain audio quality during processing.
Save a copy of the original audio file before normalizing in case you need to revert to the original levels.
noise reduction:
noise reduction is also done by the adobe audition,izotope rx,audacity,ceder audio dns series
spectral editing this technique invloves identify and selecting noise frequency withinn a recording and applying spectral editing tools.
adaptive noise reduction:it use the adaptive noise reduction
